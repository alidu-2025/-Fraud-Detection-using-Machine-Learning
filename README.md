ðŸ’³ Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

# Project Introduction
This project is part of my internship with **Oasis Infobite**, focusing on detecting fraudulent financial transactions using machine learning. The objective is to develop a robust classification model that can identify potential frauds with high precision and recall.

# Problem Statement
Financial fraud is a major issue for businesses and consumers. Using a dataset of transactions, we aim to classify which ones are fraudulent based on patterns and statistical features.

# Workflow Summary
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Handling Imbalanced Data (SMOTE, Under/Over Sampling)
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
5. Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, F1-score)

# Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- XGBoost
- Jupyter Notebook
  
 # Results
 The final model achieved high accuracy while maintaining a strong recall rate, which is crucial in identifying fraud cases effectively. Performance metrics and plots are included in the notebook.

# How to Run
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone [https://github.com/alidu-2025/fraud-detection.git](https://github.com/alidu-2025/-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning/edit/main/README.md)

2. Navigate to the project:
   cd fraud-detection

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and follow the steps.

# Acknowledgment
Special thanks to **Oasis Infobite** for the opportunity and guidance during this project.
